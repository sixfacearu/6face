Collection Framework In Java
1]Synchronization and Non-Synchronization
       synchronization
                single thread perform multiple opertation one by one its called synchronization (vector list)
       non-synchronization
                 multiple thread perform multiple operation at a time its called non synchronization (array list) example :one thread perofm add operation another one perform remove operation at the same time
                  
       synchronization is safe compare to non-synchronization
       non-synchronization provide better performance compare synchronization
       synchronization consumes more time compare to non synchronization
       but synchronization is thread-safe .

2-ArrayList and Linked List in collection

                 arraylist and linkedlist is a same but its have few differece
                     i)searching-searching is arraylist better compare to linked list
                                  becoze its index based search .get(index) =>.get(1)
                                 Linked list is a traversed based searching all element 				searched one by one  .get(n)

		     ii)deletion:deletion is linked list better compare to array list
				 linked list deletion o(1).arraylist =>o(n).

		     iii)adding:adding linked list better then araylist
=======================================================================================
3]HASH-MAP AND HASH TABLE
                        i)hashmap-non-synchronized (good performance but not-thread safe)
                             hashmap-does't maintain(order)
			ii)hashtable-synchronized  (bad performance but thread safe)
                             hashtable maintain order
========================================================================================
4]HASH-SET AND TREE SET
                        I]hash set provide good performance and faster compare       to                        treeset
			II]hase set is does't maintain order(asending)
			
                        III]treeset provide order(A to Z)
=======================================================================================
5]arraylist-hashmap
                    arraylist create using list interface
                    hashmap create using map interface
                    arraylist consume low memory space compare to hashmap
                    arraylist allow duplicate hashmap doesnot allow duplicate
                    getmethod in arraylist using index hashmap using key
========================================================================================
6]List vs Map vs Set
                 LISt=>i)list allows duplicate element eny number of duplicate element
                       without affecting another type .Implement list interface
          	 ORDER=>ii)list display insertion order
                 SET=>set does't allows duplicate element its implemented using setInterface
                Map=>stroe the element using(key and value).does not allow duplicate using map interface to implement map
